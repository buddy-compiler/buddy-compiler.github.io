## Collaboration System Guide

### Introduction

The Collaboration System provides a user-friendly interface showcasing the various projects, tasks, and team members associated with the Buddy Compiler community.

- **The Buddy Compiler Projects Page** ([Link](https://buddycompiler.notion.site/7f92ee739453461d956b5b4e4bb73bf1?v=70f2180e94ce4f7fa5bac01f4b47b98e&pvs=4)) displays all projects and progress in a timeline view. The upkeep of this page is handled by maintainers of different projects.

- **The Buddy Compiler Tasks Page** ([Link](https://buddycompiler.notion.site/3f4b8e480d6e447dbd4c3b3e21fa1208?v=8dc8526cba2245a98a726be1c08e0f6b&pvs=4)) shows all tasks in a table view. Contributions from every contributor are automatically added to this board. For newcomers looking to contribute, projects labeled as `open` are available to explore and work on.

- **The Buddy Compiler Team Page** ([Link](https://buddycompiler.notion.site/c912d8237b79409c89cf46b432b6a3ca?v=186d4ed4b9fa4452a08ca5af0921208a&pvs=4)) presents all contributors in a gallery view. Every contributor is represented with a unique card. Contributors are encouraged to personalize their cards to reflect their style. It's essential for each contributor to keep their task list updated in line with their assigned tasks. Additionally, tasks listed on these cards are directly linked to entries on the Buddy Compiler Tasks and Projects pages.

### Principles

- **Self-Responsibility:** You are responsible for maintaining your own card. Don't hesitate to tell everyone how awesome you are!

- **Every Step Counts:** All projects, tasks, and personal cards are publicly available. All your impressive contributions won't go unnoticed; they will be appreciated and remembered!

- **Contribute More, Get More:** The completion of tasks directly influences the compensation for interns and employees. Please keep a careful record of your tasks and try harder!

- **Personal Branding:** Your personal cards represent your open-source contributions to Buddy Compiler. Feel free to share your personal card link. We believe it could be a standout feature on your resume!

### Usage Instructions
